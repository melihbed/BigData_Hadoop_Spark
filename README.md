# BigData_Hadoop_Spark
We can cut off large group of codes with the PyCaret which is an open-source, low-code machine learning library in Python that automates machine learning workflows. 
It is an end-to-end machine learning and model management tool that exponentially speeds up the experiment cycle and makes you more productive.
On the other hand, Spark was designed for fast, interactive computation that runs in memory, enabling machine learning to run quickly. 
The algorithms include the ability to do classification, regression, clustering, collaborative filtering, and pattern mining. 
As you may know, today, the Hadoop ecosystem includes many tools and applications to help collect, store, process, analyze, and manage big data.
And we'll be working on that particular library.
